In the time domain:
Looks like a cosine signal with amplitude that gets smaller with time (damped cosine).
This is expected, because the filter tries to adapt to target a specific frequency (the dominant one in the reference signal).
The reason why damping exists is because the filter has finite length (FIR), so it can't model the reference signal perfectly.
If we wanted to approximate it perfectly we would need infinite number of taps (IIR).
The filter only captures L coefficients, just a window, of the reference signal (sinusoid).


In the frequency domain:
The FFT has a peak centered at the dominant frequency.
Elsewhere, it has no special/remarkable curves.
This makes sense due to the duality rule: long, clean, undamped sinusoid in time gives very narrow peak in frequency,
	while a shorted, more damped signal gives a wider and fuzzier peak.
The reason why we don't have just a narrow clean peak in frequency is because there is "spectral leakage".
The damped cosine in time gives extra smaller frequencies around the dominant one, so the damping spreads energy around the main frequency (leakage).
If we had a pure cosine in infinite time, in the spectrum we would have a delta function which has energy in only one frequency.
We don't want and expect curves or peaks at other frequencies, because we don't want the filter to affect frequencies where
	there is no correlated noise, we don't want it to waste energy adapting where it's not needed.
If there are smaller peaks or curves elsewhere (away from the main frequency), then that could be because of:
	-leakage (due to smaller frequencies from damped cosine)
	-higher harmonics if the reference signal is non-sinusoidal or clipped
	-convergence noise
	-primary/secondary path effects (smaller ones at other frequencies)
	-numerical reasons (windowing, smoothing, FFT resolution)
If the frequencies other than the main are considerably big, then this could signal instability or huge leakage.
