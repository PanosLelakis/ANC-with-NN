1. I calculate the performance metrics (convergence speed and steady state error) based on
the smoothed version of the error signal, because the raw error signal has a lot of spikes
and it also has extremely high values at the beginning. Am I wrong to use the smoothed
error signal?

2. When plotting the error signal in dB, should I use dBFS or simply dB?

3. When plotting multiple signals in dBFS, should I calculate their values based on the
max values of each signal individually (eg. when converting signal A to dBFS should I
calculate its value using the max value of signal A and signal B in dBFS based on the max
value of signal B, OR signal A in dBFS based on max(A) and signal B in dBFS based on max(A)
as well)?
