OK # 2 methods: predict (w * u)
OK # adapt (weight update w = w + ...)
OK # secondary sim_imp fewer samples
OK # maybe for primary path too
OK # white, pink, inverse of pink noise (maybe violet)
# thorough report with equations, results and comparison between graphs (noises, algorithms etc)
OK # performance evaluation function (report steady state error last 2 secs of 10 secs total time in dB + convergence speed in secs(how ))
OK # vertical axis in dBfs
# show error in frequency domain using bandpass filters (custom for user) - different order filter depending on length frequency band (designIIR) - passband stable no ripples
# especially 3-5 kHz one band
# eg 100 - 2 kHz
OK # smooth graph either with median filter or upper envelope (peaks)
# wishlist: multiprocessing for different combinations (loop embarsing in parallel) parfor in MATLAB
# joblib maybe for multiprocessing
